    "review": "## Literature Analysis\n\nThis paper represents a significant contribution to the field. Based on my analysis of the citation network and related works:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- The methodology builds upon well-established foundations\n- Citation patterns suggest high community acceptance\n- 3 prior works attempted similar approaches with limited success\n\n**Gaps Identified:**\n1. Reproducibility data is incomplete — key hyperparameters are omitted\n2. The evaluation benchmark has known limitations\n3. Comparison with concurrent work is missing\n\n**Verdict:** The claims are largely supported by the evidence, though replication would require additional experimental details not present in the manuscript.",
    "analyse": "## Deep Literature Survey\n\nSearching the knowledge graph reveals 12 directly related papers and 47 papers within 2 citation hops.\n\n**Lineage:** This work descends from the attention mechanism lineage (Bahdanau 2015 → Vaswani 2017) with influences from residual learning (He 2016).\n\n**Novelty Assessment:** The core contribution — applying the technique to this specific domain — appears genuinely novel. However, the mathematical framework closely mirrors prior work.\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Computational requirements may limit independent replication\n- Dataset availability is uncertain\n- Two of four evaluation metrics are non-standard"

    "review": "## Architectural Analysis\n\n**Experimental Design Quality:** 7/10\n\nThe paper's experimental framework demonstrates:\n- Appropriate baseline selection (4 competitive methods)\n- Standard evaluation protocol with 5-fold cross-validation\n- Statistical significance testing (p < 0.05)\n\n**Methodological Concerns:**\n1. The ablation study is insufficient — only 2 of 5 components are tested\n2. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis is absent\n3. The training procedure description lacks crucial details\n\n**Replication Blueprint:**\n- Estimated compute: 8 GPU-hours on A100\n- Data preprocessing: 3 critical steps identified\n- Expected variance: ±2.3% based on similar architectures",
    "analyse": "## Research Architecture Review\n\nThe proposed architecture combines three established components in a novel configuration:\n\n1. **Encoder:** Standard transformer with 12 layers (well-understood)\n2. **Bridge Module:** Novel cross-attention mechanism (requires careful validation)\n3. **Decoder:** Modified autoregressive head (moderate replication risk)\n\n**Critical Path:** The bridge module is the primary source of both novelty and risk. I recommend prioritising its validation during any replication attempt."

    "review": "## Computational Feasibility Report\n\n**Hardware Requirements:**\n- Training: 4x NVIDIA A100 (80GB) for 72 hours\n- Inference: Single A100, ~50ms per sample\n- Storage: 2.3TB for full dataset + checkpoints\n\n**Estimated Replication Cost:** $2,400 (cloud compute)\n\n**Simulation Results:**\n- Based on scaling laws, the reported performance is plausible\n- Memory footprint analysis confirms the stated batch size is feasible\n- The training curve should converge within the reported epochs\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Medium — the compute requirements are substantial but within reach of well-funded research groups.",
    "analyse": "## Computational Analysis\n\nRunning scaled-down simulation with 10% of reported parameters:\n\n- Forward pass verified: gradient flow is stable\n- Loss landscape appears well-conditioned\n- No numerical instabilities detected at FP16 precision\n\nProjected full-scale results align with claims (within 5% margin)."
