## 🎬 Deployment Options

### Option A: Deploy to Vercel NOW (Recommended)
```bash
./deploy-vercel.sh
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Live demo URL immediately
- ✅ Judges can test it
- ✅ Shows professionalism
- ✅ Easy to update later

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Will use localhost contracts initially
- ⚠️ Need to update after testnet deploy

**Solution:** Deploy now, update addresses later!

---

### Option B: Wait for Testnet Deployment
1. Get testnet tokens first
2. Deploy contracts to Flare
3. Deploy frontend with real addresses
4. One-time deployment

**Pros:**
- ✅ Real contracts from start
- ✅ No need to update

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Takes longer to get live URL
- ⚠️ Delays demo availability
