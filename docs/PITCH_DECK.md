# Decentralized Research Graph - Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title
**🔬 Decentralized Research Graph**

*Revolutionizing Academic Publishing with Fair Incentives*

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Academic Publishing is Broken

📊 **$2B+ in unpaid peer review annually**
- Researchers review for free while publishers profit

🎲 **Citation gaming & replication crisis**
- No incentives for replication
- Citation cartels manipulate metrics

🔒 **Closed access monopolies**
- Publishers charge $30-50 per paper
- Researchers can't access their own work

⏰ **Months-long review delays**
- Manual assignment, slow feedback
- No accountability

---

## Slide 3: Our Solution

### Blockchain-Based Knowledge Graph

💰 **Get Paid for Reviews**
- $100 USDC per review via Plasma
- Instant settlement, no delays

🎁 **Citation Rewards**
- Earn tokens when your work is cited
- Replication bonuses for reproducibility

✅ **External Data Verification**
- Flare FDC verifies DOI, citations, replications
- No more fake papers or citation gaming

🎲 **Fair Review Assignment**
- Flare RNG randomly assigns reviewers
- Prevents bias and collusion

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

### 4-Step Process

**1. Submit Paper** ($50 USDC)
- Upload to IPFS
- FDC verifies DOI via CrossRef
- Automatic reviewer assignment via RNG

**2. Peer Review** (Earn $100 USDC)
- Reviewers stake tokens (slashed if poor quality)
- Anonymous assignment via Flare RNG
- Instant payment via Plasma

**3. Acceptance** (Earn RESEARCH tokens)
- Auto-accept if score ≥ 7/10
- Author earns 100 governance tokens
- Listed in public knowledge graph

**4. Citations & Replications**
- Each citation: +10 RESEARCH tokens
- Each replication: +50 tokens (author) + 25 tokens (replicator)

---

## Slide 5: Technology Stack

### Powered by Flare & Plasma

**🌟 Flare Network**
- **FDC**: External data verification
  - CrossRef API (DOI validation)
  - arXiv (preprint metadata)
  - GitHub (replication studies)
- **FTSO**: Token price feeds (RESEARCH/USD)
- **RNG**: Random reviewer assignment

**💰 Plasma Network**
- Stablecoin payments (USDC)
- Fast settlement (<1s)
- Privacy-preserving peer review
- Low fees for micropayments

**🗄️ Storage**
- IPFS: Decentralized paper storage
- Ethereum: Immutable record

---

## Slide 6: Novel Innovation

### First Academic Platform with On-Chain External Data Verification

**Traditional Approach:**
```
Paper → Trust publisher → Hope it's real
```

**Our Approach:**
```
Paper → Flare FDC → Verify CrossRef → Cryptographic proof
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Stop fake papers before blockchain commit
- ✅ Verify citations from external databases
- ✅ Track replications from GitHub/OSF
- ✅ Detect plagiarism via data comparison

**This is impossible without Flare's FDC**

---

## Slide 7: Token Economics

### Dual Token System

**💵 USDC (Stablecoin on Plasma)**
- Submission: $50
- Review reward: $100
- Access fees: Variable

**🎫 RESEARCH (Governance on Flare)**
- Paper acceptance: 100 tokens
- Citation reward: 10 tokens
- Replication reward: 50 tokens
- Verification bonus: 50 tokens

**Why Dual Token?**
- USDC = Stable transactions (no volatility)
- RESEARCH = Long-term alignment (governance)

---

## Slide 8: Market Opportunity

### Massive TAM

**📚 Academic Publishing Market**
- $19B annually (2025)
- Growing 4% YoY
- 3M+ papers published/year

**🔬 Peer Review Market**
- 15M+ reviews annually
- $2B in unpaid labor
- 100% addressable

**🎯 Target Users**
- 10M+ active researchers worldwide
- Early adopters: Preprint servers (arXiv, bioRxiv)
- Future: Replace traditional journals

---

## Slide 9: Business Model

### Revenue Streams

**1. Submission Fees** ($50/paper)
- 3M papers/year = $150M potential revenue
- 80% to reviewers, 20% to platform

**2. Access Fees** (Future)
- Pay-per-view: $1-5 per paper
- Subscriptions: $10/month unlimited

**3. API Licensing** (Future)
- Journals pay to use our review layer
- $1,000-10,000/month per journal

**4. Token Appreciation**
- Platform growth increases RESEARCH value
- Treasury holds 10% of supply

## Slide 10: Competitive Advantage

### Why We Win

| Feature | Traditional Publishers | Our Platform |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|
| Review payment | ❌ Free labor | ✅ $100 USDC |
| Citation rewards | ❌ None | ✅ 10 tokens |
| Access cost | ❌ $30-50 | ✅ Free/low cost |
| Verification | ❌ Trust-based | ✅ FDC verified |
| Review speed | ❌ Months | ✅ Days |
| Transparency | ❌ Closed | ✅ On-chain |

**Moat:**
- Network effects (more papers = more value)
- Token ecosystem (locked-in users)
- Flare FDC integration (hard to replicate)
